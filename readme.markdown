# codebux

This program computes technical debt for node programs.

Lines of code are spent. You start at $100. You don't get any more codebux.
There are many ways to fuck up:

* too much code
* too much indentation
* too much nested state
* not having tests
* not having a readme
* not having examples
* not having code in your readme

Your codebux doesn't stop at $0. It could very easily be in the negative
hundreds of thousands or even millions for especially sprawling projects.

Such is the pernicious trap of technical debt. It's quite easy to destroy more
value than you create.
